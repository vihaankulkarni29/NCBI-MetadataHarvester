# Deployment and Operations Plan

## Containerization
- Docker image with FastAPI app and worker
- Config via environment variables (API keys, limits, storage)

## Environments
- Dev: local Docker Compose (API + Redis + worker)
- Staging/Prod: Cloud run target (AWS ECS/Fargate, Azure App Service + Container, or GCP Cloud Run)

## Storage
- Object storage bucket for results; signed URL downloads
- Optional Postgres for jobs/users; SQLite acceptable for dev

## Monitoring and Logging
- Structured JSON logs; collect with CloudWatch/Log Analytics/Stackdriver
- Metrics: Prometheus/OpenTelemetry; basic dashboards
- Alerts on error rates and job failures

## Security
- API keys/JWT; per-user quotas
- Secrets in Key Vault/Secrets Manager
- HTTPS only; CORS as needed

## Cost Control
- Scale-to-zero where possible (GCP Cloud Run / Azure Container Apps)
- Batch work off-hours; cache aggressively
